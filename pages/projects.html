					<h2>Current Mermaid Project</h2>
					<p>Tulle tulle is all the rage with an alluring femininity under the lens. Sue Bryce, one amazing photographer I adore, uses tulle in her educational series. I read an article in a photo magazine - technically on-line, SLR Lounge featured some of her techniques. Brilliant. I started to google this influence and images that populated my screen, inspired a whole new world of transparency. I love transparency. The minute I saw print and the negative process I was hooked. The NEGATIVE. It always looked different, lighter, emphasis on opposite details than expected. </p>
					<p>Printmaking was an original art course that embellished the creativity of one color processing and the negative. Graphic design references to print days and 2 color presses. These presses still exist, I just moved to web as it was even more transparent. These processes were enlightening my awareness to the transparency in our world and how we reflect within light and surface.</p> 
					<p>The other amazing thing about negative and print is the layering of color. Red over Blue highlights purple. The use of two letters overlayed shapes could lead to something in purple! The sheer joy I felt when i gazed at that for the first time. Memories. </p>
					<p>Back to the fabrics in question and sheer organza are all the characteristics of this mermaid project. The epiphany struck as I photographed my goldfish in its pond while the water reflected the clouds and blue sky. My first ever SOOC surrealist example - iPhone of course.</p>
					<p> Now I reveled in the transparency of the fantail fin swirling around in a rythmic fashion. Its light flickering dance around water molecules as the fish swims along. How does one represent this airy flutter of the tail?</p>
					
					<p>Whites oranges and browns represent the fish color but the magic is in the airy fabrics. The drapery is reflective of gills, fins and puffer goldfish eyes. Where to place this majestic fish tail? Keep following to find out.</p>

				<h2>Conceptualizing Jellyfish</h2>
				<p>A friend showed me a lamp shade made of water bottle ends of plastic. It was a chandelier draping down upon the floor. A tall lamp shade, simplified into strings of plastic circles. I couldnt stop thinking about jellyfish after that moment. They are an interesting creature and you guessed it, transparent creatures.</p>
				<p>As time permitted, I gathered ideas and harvested a couple antique chandelbar style standing lamps. Eventually time indulges a realization of jellyfish in this lamp shade conceptual.</p>

					<h2>Coding Project</h2>
					<p>I came to discover my need to upgrade all my hardware to new technologies for supporting my love of the photograph and its life cycle. Believe it or not, a photo can really die. Since google inception perhaps not but it will go way way way down in rankings and what if it is a dead link?</p>
					<p>Well, on the contrary side of photos being lost, my daughter has a published book of greatest magazine photos by years. This I pledge to recreate but we're talking here of my area of career for money focus. I am recently revisiting web design as I learn fluid layouts mixed with responsive ones. This site itself (crystalhansenartographic.com) is a reflection of skims from the net responsive exercises.</p>
					<p>Flex model is interesting and for the first time I could visualize a web like magazine quality layout. Digging into the css means and playing with multiple skins of demos, the site is evolving as I refresh html5, css3 components without javascript. Love Hate Javascript. Yea its quick relatively easy but really its a script. Timers ugh... gross.</p>
					<p>This is supposed to be about the development of apps for the western digital.</p>

					<h2>Montreal Project</h2>
					<p>Well, on the contrary side of photos being lost, my daughter has a published book of greatest magazine photos by years. This I pledge to recreate but we're talking here of my area of career for money focus. I am recently revisiting web design as I learn fluid layouts mixed with responsive ones. This site itself (crystalhansenartographic.com) is a reflection of skims from the net responsive exercises.</p>
					<p>I have decided to attempt this while traveling to Montreal, QC to find more creative influence upon my talented brain cells.</p>
					<p>Cardboard Picture frames reveal what? a dress? my art pallet with crayons half melt glued. and a paint brush.</p>
